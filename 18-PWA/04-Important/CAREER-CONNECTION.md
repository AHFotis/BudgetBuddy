### Introduction

You're covering Progressive Web Applications and are learning how to optimize legacy applications to ensure that they are more accessible to devices running on slower connections. We get it, at first, this might not seem like an incredibly exciting topic—but it's an incredibly important skillset to have as you start talking with prospective employers!

In an ideal world, we'd all love to go out and write good code using the latest technologies, React, Express and others you might not even have heard of like GraphQL—the reality, however, is a little different. Many companies, even when writing new applications using the latest technologies, are still maintaining older applications written in legacy code. In all likelihood, these won't be React applications, but a mixture of vanilla JavaScript, jQuery and server-side languages like PHP instead of NodeJS.

So when you go out on that job interview, remember to tell the interviewer what you can do for their legacy applications while _also_ developing their cutting-edge applications.

#### Employer Competitive Advantage

Are you already looking at companies that you'd like to interview with? If not, then start with Step 1. If you already have a list of companies that you're interested in working for in the future, jump over to Step 2.

#### Step 1

* Head over the [LinkedIn Jobs](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/) and you can add some search terms in to the "Search jobs" field. Some options include `javascript developer`, `react developer`, `front end developer`, `back end developer`, `full stack developer` or `software developer`. In the location, add either your current location or the place you would like to work in and hit "Search".

* Write down the names of 3-4 companies that have open positions that you've either heard of or seem like places (from the job description) you'd like to work at

#### Step 2

* Using one of the companies you'd like to work at, locate their home page
* Once on their home page, run a Lighthouse audit using "Applied Slow 4G" enabled
* Note the areas that you could improve their website/web application and how, using the skills you learned this week, you could improve the audit scores

### Looking to the Future

_Developing your PWA Knowledge_
Converting a website or an application to a PWA is a skill that takes practice, you can do so following these three key steps:

**1. Analyze the website or application to identify problem areas.**

* Are the images, CSS, and JavasScript files too large?
* Could the CSS and JavaScript files be combined?
* Could images be lazy-loaded?
* Could the website or application be converted to a PWA?

**2. Develop solutions to reduce these problems.**
* Compress the images
* Use webpack to minimize CSS an JavaScript
* Use webpack to implement tree-shaking
* Lazy-load images so they load when they scroll into view
* Assess whether the website or application could work as a PWA. Does the content update infrequently? Could it function offline? Would it make fewer network requests?

**3. Implement the solutions you have developed.**

As a beginner, it can be hard to know what exactly the best steps are, but doing it multiple times will help you on your way.

#### Your Task

* Once you've completed this week's homework and project, grab 2 or 3 websites / applications that you have built during the coding bootcamp so far and complete a Performance Audit on them

* Write down where you can optimize those applications

* Implement fixes for them

### Technical Interview Preparation

Many companies use algorithm questions during the technical interview. We strongly recommend that you practice these. Doing so will prepare you to handle some of the most common questions in an interview or promotion discussion.

Please refer to the class repository to find these algorithms:

Coding Algorithm #1: Is Armstrong

Coding Algorithm #2: Max Profit

Coding Algorithm #3: Smallest Difference

For practice in a live, interview-style IDE, complete the following algorithm challenge. The solution will be discussed in the weekly recommended session.

Once you start, you'll have seven days to complete it. After the seven days has elapsed, the challenge will close.
